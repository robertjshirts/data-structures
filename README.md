# Data Structures
This is my personal implementation of some data structures to prove my competence with them.
The only external packages I used was the "testing" package to test each data structure, and fmt to format generics to strings.


## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need Golang installed on your system. The project was build with Go1.21.6, but might work with older versions.
Once you have Go set up, you can clone the repo and naviage to it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robertjshirts/data-structures.git
cd data-structures
```

Currently, I only run the project by running my test files, as there is no code in my main.go file. To run the tests, use the following command
```bash
go test ./...
```

# TODO
- Update tests to use modern sub testing and tables. Look into that.
